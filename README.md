# k-means-clustering

k -means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which serves many purposes. This report focuses on using R language to cluster a movie dataset based on budget and gross in order to find a suitable cluster of movies to be added to a company’s movie database. ‘Movie_metadata’
published in Kaggle is the dataset used in this report. The distance measure used by the k -
means clustering in this report is the Euclidean distance. Within Sum of Squares is used in
conjunction with an elbow plot to identify the optimal number of clusters. The first analysis
was carried out using the optimal k value, after which the k value is increased, and the analysis
was carried out again. Using the knowledge gained from the two analysis, 100 movies were
selected to be added to the company’s database.
